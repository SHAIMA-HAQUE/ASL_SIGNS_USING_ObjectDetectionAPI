1. Git clone this repo
2. We need a virtual environment using Python 3.9 and Tensorflow 2.13.0  (very important)

```conda create -n py39 python=3.9```
```conda activate py39```

3. Try `python --version` and 
`python -c "import tensorflow as tf;print(tf.reduce_sum(tf.random.normal([1000, 1000])))"` to test if they are installed correctly 

4.  In the terminal cd into Tensorflow folder and run `git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/models.git`. You should get a models folder containing the entire repo inside it

5. Also in the terminal run the following commands -  `wget https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v3.13.0/protoc-3.13.0-linux-x86_64.zip`

6. `cd ./Tensorflow/models/research`

7. `protoc object_detection/protos/*.proto --python_out=.`

8. `git clone https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi.git`

9. `cd cocoapi/PythonAPI`

10. `make`

11. `cp -r pycocotools /content/tensorflow_models/models/research`

12. `python -m pip install .` OR pip install tf-models-official (this command helped passed the test cases in Step 13 for some)

The command below will run inside `Tensorflow/models/research`

13. `python object_detection/builders/model_builder_tf2_test.py` - all tests should pass here if your python and tensorflow versions are alright. If not some problems and their potential solutions which I had referred to are added below.

14. The above steps will make the object detection api ready to use

15. Go to `train.ipynb` in code and change the `label names`. Create the tfrecord and check if they are present in annotations folder

16. Next all instructions are given in code
